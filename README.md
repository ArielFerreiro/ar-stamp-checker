The idea is to develop a model that given a picture (taken with a mobile phone) will:

1) Detect automatically the positioning of the label in the image
2) Analize the label characteristics and detect if the label is genuine or fake

then in the same repo we will store a mobile App made in Flutter that will make use of the model
to provide usability of it to end-users.
